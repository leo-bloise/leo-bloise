# Hello, Traveler 🖖

I'm Leo, full-stack engineer with an obsession for understanding how the magic works under the hood, and rebuilding everything from scratch just to see if I can do it.

- ⚙️ I use daily: Node.js, Next.js, Typescript, React, C#, <b>.NET Core</b>, <b>ASP.NET Core</b> and Python.
- 🗃️ Databases: <b>PostgreSQL</b>, <b>Redis</b>, Mongo DB
- ☁️ Cloud: Azure and AWS
- 🐳 Container: Docker and Docker Compose

Ping me about application development, systems integration, systems architecture 🧙
